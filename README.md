Hebrew web site for tours in cambridge

This Django apps is used in https://cambridgeinhebrew.com.

I'm a beginner, so don't take anything as granted!!!

This Django apps has some good stuff that I gathered from other places,
here is the list:

1. This website is in hebrew, from right to left.
2. using Stripe to collect money via credit cards.
3. Sending emails.

Plans for the feature

1. Create pdf document for reciept
2. Add Apps for bloging - I believe there is a nice django one that hopefully I can use.


If you have any questions, I'll be more than happy to help.
